          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 1Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (1931–2015), fondly known as the "Missile Man of India," was an esteemed Indian aerospace scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India (2002–2007). Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, into a modest family, he rose to prominence through hard work and dedication.

            Kalam played a pivotal role in India's defense and space research. As a scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), he contributed significantly to India's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. His leadership in developing the Agni and Prithvi missiles earned him the nickname "Missile Man."
            
            In 1998, Kalam was instrumental in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, which marked India as a nuclear power. He was awarded numerous honors, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.
            
            As President, Kalam was deeply loved for his humility and vision for India’s development. He envisioned India as a developed nation by 2020 and inspired millions, particularly the youth, with his book Wings of Fire and motivational talks.
            
            Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration, innovation, and selfless service to the nation.
